# Classifying-MNIST-Dataset-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

This project is designed to deepen your understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their practical application, specifically in the context of image classification. The primary objective is to create a CNN-based model on Google Colab for the purpose of classifying digits using the well-known MNIST dataset. The report section will include a comprehensive mathematical breakdown, utilizing matrix outputs, to elucidate the step-by-step processing of a representative image.

In the introductory phase, the MNIST dataset will be elucidated, followed by the setup procedures on Google Colab. The core of the project involves constructing CNN models, where explanations will be provided on the incorporation of input layers, convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Multiple variations of these models will be created, tested, and their architectural variances and consequential effects on classification outcomes will be detailed.

The subsequent step focuses on training the model using the MNIST dataset, showcasing the intricacies of the training process. The report section will delve into the architectural structures of the CNN models, articulating the specifics of the convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, and other essential parameters. The total count of model parameters will be enumerated, and details about the datasets used in training, validation, and testing will be provided.

Graphs illustrating the progression of loss and accuracy over each epoch during the training process will be included. The report will discuss the performance during training, analyzing for signs of overfitting. The outcomes of the trained models on the test dataset, including accuracy rates, will be presented, alongside a confusion matrix showcasing classification results for each class.

Precision, recall, and F1-score metrics will be calculated and presented for each class. The report will also encompass a detailed explanation of the hyperparameters employed during model training, such as learning rate, mini-batch size, and epoch count, along with the rationale behind their selection.

A significant component of the report will focus on an illustrative example, particularly the mathematical demonstration of the processing steps for a chosen digit "5." This demonstration will traverse from the transformation of the image into a numerical matrix to the final prediction of the model.

In conclusion, this README.md file serves as a comprehensive guide to the project, encapsulating its objectives, methodologies, findings, and crucial elements related to the implementation of CNN models for MNIST digit classification on Google Colab.
